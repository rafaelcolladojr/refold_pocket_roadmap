## Introduction

The Pocket Roadmap was made to enhance the immersion-based language learning experience of those off the grid. Providing an entirely offline experience, users can travel or simply disconnected without leaving their Refold articles behind.

## What It's Not

The app, while serving as a native mobile alternative to the [refold.la](https://refold.la/) website, is not intended as a replacement. Nor does its creator claim ownership of the Refold Languages brand, trademarks, logo, or texts.
